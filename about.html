My name is Orhan Albayati, and I'm a student at Teknikh√∂gskolan studying to
become a .NET Developer. This blog has been made for studying purposes and the
content might be faulty in some occasions. But I am doing my best to comprehend
and express different kind of terminology that I have been exposed to. I will
try to be as precise as I can to explain different terms in the way that I
understand them, which as I just mentioned, might not be entirely correct. If
you have any suggestions or tips regarding the content (it could be changes)
then please let me know! You can always contact me through the footer section
below by Email or my Github profile. Have a good day!
