# Introduction

This post will be about CI (Continuous Integration) pipelines. I will go through fundamental basics of CI and what it is (atleast I will try to explain it as good as I can). Furthermore I will try to implement a CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions into an already existing repository/project. I will do this by 'forking' an GitHub repository/project. My goal is to make sure that the CI Pipeline activates on every commit to our fork on all branches. When I have succeeded with that I will try to explain the necessary steps that I took and how the process looked like in this blog post. I will also describe my GitHub action YAML file.
