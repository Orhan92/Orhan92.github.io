# Introduction

This post will be about CI (Continuous Integration) pipelines. I will go through fundamental basics of CI and what it is (atleast I will try to explain it as good as I can). Furthermore we will try to implement a CI Pipeline with GitHub Actions into one of our already existing repositories/projects. We will do this by 'forking'a GitHub project on our own repo. Our goal is to make sure that the CI Pipeline activates on every commit to our fork on all branches. When I have succeeded with that I will try to explain the necessary steps that I took and how the process looked like in this blog post. I will also describemy GitHub action YAML file.
