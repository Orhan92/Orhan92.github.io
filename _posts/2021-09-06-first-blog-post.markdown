## Introduction

Today we have been learning about different cloud solutions such as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service). We have been going through basics of networking and some recap from our last course before the summer break. That recap included: .NET Core, Razor Pages, Dependency Injections, Docker, API, Security and more. I am not going to go through everything that have been recapped during todays lecture. I just wanted to give you a brief overview of what we have been doing during our lecture today.

The most interesting part in todays lecture was going through and touching the tip of the fundamentals and basics of cloud solutions. In the section below I will try to do my best to explain my perception of what 'The Cloud' is.
