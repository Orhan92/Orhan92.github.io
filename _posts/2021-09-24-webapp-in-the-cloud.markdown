# Introcution

In this blog post we will create a ASP.NET Web application with Razor Pages.
The application is going to do the same things as the functions we created in the [Previous Blog Post](https://orhan92.github.io/jekyll/update/2021/09/22/database-in-the-cloud.html) with minor changes. Instead of giving a `searchterm` to get a specific artist we will instead retrieve every document inside of our database. Our application will establish a connection with our Cosmos Db where we can Post a song with a title or retrieve all documents inside of our database.
