# Introduction

Today we are going to create Azure functions (POST and GET) and a CosmosDB. Main purpose here is that our functions are going to send requests to our database. We should be able to POST and GET information to/from the database. This blog post will describe:

- My application and how it works
- Description of the Source Code
- Description of the CosmosDb
- How did we deploy the Azure functions?
- Database scheme changes (Ã„NDRA DENNA)
- Estimated cost to run this application (1. Almost no users, 2. Alot of users)
